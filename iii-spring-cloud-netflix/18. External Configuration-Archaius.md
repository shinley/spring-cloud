## 18. External Configuration: Archaius

[Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius)is the Netflix client side configuration library. It is the library used by all of the Netflix OSS components for configuration. Archaius is an extension of the[Apache Commons Configuration](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration)project. It allows updates to configuration by either polling a source for changes or for a source to push changes to the client. Archaius uses Dynamic&lt;Type&gt;Property classes as handles to properties.

**Archaius Example. **

```
class ArchaiusTest {
    DynamicStringProperty myprop = DynamicPropertyFactory
            .getInstance()
            .getStringProperty("my.prop");

    void doSomething() {
        OtherClass.someMethod(myprop.get());
    }
}
```

Archaius has its own set of configuration files and loading priorities. Spring applications should generally not use Archaius directly, but the need to configure the Netflix tools natively remains. Spring Cloud has a Spring Environment Bridge so Archaius can read properties from the Spring Environment. This allows Spring Boot projects to use the normal configuration toolchain, while allowing them to configure the Netflix tools, for the most part, as documented.
