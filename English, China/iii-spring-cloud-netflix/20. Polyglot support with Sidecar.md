## 20. Polyglot support with Sidecar

Do you have non-jvm languages you want to take advantage of Eureka, Ribbon and Config Server? The Spring Cloud Netflix Sidecar was inspired by[Netflix Prana](https://github.com/Netflix/Prana). It includes a simple http api to get all of the instances (ie host and port) for a given service. You can also proxy service calls through an embedded Zuul proxy which gets its route entries from Eureka. The Spring Cloud Config Server can be accessed directly via host lookup or through the Zuul Proxy. The non-jvm app should implement a health check so the Sidecar can report to eureka if the app is up or down.

To include Sidecar in your project use the dependency with group`org.springframework.cloud`and artifact id`spring-cloud-netflix-sidecar`.

To enable the Sidecar, create a Spring Boot application with`@EnableSidecar`. This annotation includes`@EnableCircuitBreaker`,`@EnableDiscoveryClient`, and`@EnableZuulProxy`. Run the resulting application on the same host as the non-jvm application.

To configure the side car add`sidecar.port`and`sidecar.health-uri`to`application.yml`. The`sidecar.port`property is the port the non-jvm app is listening on. This is so the Sidecar can properly register the app with Eureka. The`sidecar.health-uri`is a uri accessible on the non-jvm app that mimicks a Spring Boot health indicator. It should return a json document like the following:

**health-uri-document. **

    {
      "status":"UP"
    }
    

Here is an example application.yml for a Sidecar application:

**application.yml. **

    server:
      port: 5678
    spring:
      application:
        name: sidecar
    
    sidecar:
      port: 8000
      health-uri: http://localhost:8000/health.json
    

The api for the`DiscoveryClient.getInstances()`method is`/hosts/{serviceId}`. Here is an example response for`/hosts/customers`that returns two instances on different hosts. This api is accessible to the non-jvm app (if the sidecar is on port 5678) at[`http://localhost:5678/hosts/{serviceId}`](http://localhost:5678/hosts/%7BserviceId%7D).

**/hosts/customers. **

    [
        {
            "host": "myhost",
            "port": 9000,
            "uri": "http://myhost:9000",
            "serviceId": "CUSTOMERS",
            "secure": false
        },
        {
            "host": "myhost2",
            "port": 9000,
            "uri": "http://myhost2:9000",
            "serviceId": "CUSTOMERS",
            "secure": false
        }
    ]
    

The Zuul proxy automatically adds routes for each service known in eureka to`/<serviceId>`, so the customers service is available at`/customers`. The Non-jvm app can access the customer service via[`http://localhost:5678/customers`](http://localhost:5678/customers)(assuming the sidecar is listening on port 5678).

If the Config Server is registered with Eureka, non-jvm application can access it via the Zuul proxy. If the serviceId of the ConfigServer is`configserver`and the Sidecar is on port 5678, then it can be accessed at<http://localhost:5678/configserver>

Non-jvm app can take advantage of the Config Server’s ability to return YAML documents. For example, a call to<http://sidecar.local.spring.io:5678/configserver/default-master.yml>might result in a YAML document like the following

    eureka:
      client:
        serviceUrl:
          defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
      password: password
